! In DMVPN networks, spoke-to-spoke tunneling is limited to spokes that are not behind the NAT device. If
! one or both spokes are behind a NAT device, a spoke-to-spoke tunnel cannot be built to or from the NAT
! device because it is possible for the spoke-to-spoke tunnel traffic to fail or be lost for an extended period.
